Project Overview
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

Additional Components and Future Plans
I have integrated the ReactPlayer library into this project to handle video playback functionalities. In the future, I plan to expand the project by incorporating a backend using Express.js and MySQL Workbench to serve as a server-side component. This will enable the application to interact with a database and handle server-side logic efficiently. Stay tuned for further updates and enhancements!
